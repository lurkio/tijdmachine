# De Tijdmachine by Gerton A Lunter: an English translation for the BBC Micro

## Introduction
De Tijdmachine is a Dutch text adventure game that was written in BASICODE in the 1980s. I am translating the BBC Micro version of the game into English.

## History
I received the Dutch version of the game from Garry @ CASA. It was written in BASICODE that had already been customised for BBC BASIC for the BBC Micro computer. So all I have to do is translate all the Dutch text into English. The only slight problem is that I don't speak Dutch! But that's where Google Translate comes in very handy...

## Implementation
The game program consists of only one file. In that file, my English translations appear interleaved with the original Dutch text. Because each English translation always comes after the original Dutch, the entire contents of the file can be copied and pasted into an emulator (such as BeebEm) and the resulting program will run correctly because the English lines "override" the Dutch ones.
